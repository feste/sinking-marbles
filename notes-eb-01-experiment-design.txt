# Sinking Marbles

## Experiment 1

If you saw X 100 times, how many times would you see Y?

(Conditional probability prior elicitation)

## Experiment 2

N marbles fell into the pool.
John says, "(All|Most|Some) of the marbles sank."
How likely do you think it is that exactly (10) marbles sank?

## Model

Interesting prediction:
As prior probability increases from 0, the posterior probability of ALL
being true after hearing "Some" goes up for a while, then changes inflection and
goes sharply down before finally peaking again at complete certainty.

This prediction only happens when alpha > 1, when the null utterance is an
alternative, and when the relative costs of the null utterance and the
"Some" utterance is sufficiently far apart.

What if we make versions of the sentence that are costlier? Will this strengthen
the effect?

## TODOs

1. Come up with a bunch of (agentless) event pairs X and Y that vary in the
conditional probability of Y given X. From P(Y|X) = 0 to P(Y|X) = 0.5 to P(Y|X)
= 1.

2. Email Judith and CC Noah: Are you around? Or otherwise available to skype?
